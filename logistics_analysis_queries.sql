-- Project #3: International Supply Chain & LPI Score Assessment
-- Analyst: Lyle Cory Miller
-- Tools Used: Microsoft SQL Server
-- Description:
--   This script analyzes global logistics performance using the World Bank's
--   Logistics Performance Index (LPI) dataset. Queries focus on identifying
--   top and bottom performing countries by LPI and infrastructure scores,
--   tracking global performance trends over time, and providing insight into
--   regional disparities for strategic trade development.
